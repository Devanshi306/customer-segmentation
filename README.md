# customer-segmentation
The practice of dividing a company’s customers into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing such as age, gender, interests, and spending habits is nothing but Customer Segmentation.
Nowadays Companies want to know their customers better so that they can provide useful customers with some goodies and also attract customers to purchase or make some kind of business with the company. When Companies know about customers and segment it into groups, it becomes easy for companies to send customers special offers meant to encourage them to buy more products.With the help of Customer segmentation, we can also save waste of money on marketing campaigns. As we will be knowing the customers we need to target.

Required libraries for Machine Learning Customer Segmentation Project:
There are certain libraries you are required to install in your system, they are:
Numpy (pip install numpy)
Pandas (pip install pandas)
Matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)
Seaborn (pip install seaborn)
Sklearn (pip install sklearn)
mpl_toolkits (pip install mpl_toolkits)
1.) Import libraries
We have to import the required libraries that we have installed above.
2.) Load the dataset
3.) Read the dataset
Now we will load our dataset using pandas read_csv() method.
4.) Read the dataset
Now we will load our dataset using pandas read_csv() method.
5.) Visualize our dataset
Now we will visualize the dataset using matplotlib and seaborn to understand the relationship between columns.
6.) Creating Clusters
Now let’s start creating clusters for different columns of our dataset and perform k-means clustering and also visualize it.
Summary
In this machine learning project, we successfully created Segments of customers using the K-means clustering algorithm. We learned how to analyze the dataset in different ways, and also visualize the dataset to know the details of the dataset and find the relation between different columns. We also learned about K-means clustering and how to use it efficiently to create clusters and segment the data.
